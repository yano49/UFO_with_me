Game Functions -->

In this game your objective is to get the highest score as you avoid three types of projectiles : asteriods, spaces creatures and blackholes

You are given a shield that regnerates every 20 seconds and a laser that you can shoot but the ammo is limited to five. However, the ammo replenishes it's energy every 2 seconds

Your movements of the UFO are tracked by the mouse movement and there is a setting where you can either choose to either keep the music or sound effect on or not

The background images change every 35 seconds and cycles through the array of backgrounds

The score affects the speed and the score gradually increases so it gets faster and faster but the speed limit is 25
